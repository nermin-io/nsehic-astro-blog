Focused on building a suite of internal Zendesk apps for the Delivery experience team, streamlining delivery management and enhancing visibility of day-to-day deliveries. The Zendesk apps significantly improved the team's efficiency in comparison to the former system, which was a simple Excel document.

Further, I was responsible for data engineering tasks, including syncing data from our application database to BigQuery, writing SQL queries to normalise the data, and generating insights that empowered internal teams to make informed decisions.
