In this role, I expanded on my previous work by continuing to develop Zendesk apps and performing data engineering tasks.

I also took on cloud engineering responsibilities such as provisioning, configuring, and managing cloud infrastructure. I adopted and implemented IaC tools such as Terraform to automate our infrastructure and speed up delivery of new projects.

Additionally, I developed internal tools and automations beyond Zendesk, such as invoice/billing automations, HubSpot integrations, communications tools, and more.

Key achievements:
- Adopted and implemented Terraform for infrastructure management and automation. Includes implementing the review/deployment workflow using GitHub Actions, documentation, and training.
- Implemented an invoicing automation that integrates with Xero, assisting the accounting team send out invoices in a timely manner.
- Developed a suite of Zendesk apps to streamline delivery operations.
- Cloud infrastructure improvements such as deployment of new and secure VPC, streamlined TLS/SSL certificates with Google Cloud Certificate Manager, load balancer routing improvements, and more.
- Improved security by migrating from Service Account Keys to Workload Identity Federation.
